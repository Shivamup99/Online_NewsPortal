<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">The student, from Hooghly district in West Bengal, has named a few people in the note written in Bengali. Police officials were informed about the death at 8.05am, when a roommate found the youth hanging from the ceiling fan with a pajama.<br><br>
The suicide note was kept on a table beside his bed. The body was sent for an autopsy to Safdurjung Hospital and later handed over to his family.<br><br>
His elder brother told the cops that the youth had attempted suicide on April 10 by consuming sleeping pills. He was admitted to Safdurjung Hospital after which his brother took him to his apartment and counselled him for two days. On Thursday morning, he dropped the youth back to his hostel.
<br><br>Sources said police will register an FIR under sections of unnatural sexual assault and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) on the basis of the suicide note and send it the West Bengal police.
His family members have told the police that he had completed his graduation from a well-known university in Kolkata and had joined IIT two months back for his masters.<br><br>

He had never complained about being sexually assaulted when he was in Kolkata and he had shown no signs of depression either. The note has been sent for forensic analysis.
His brother is taking the body home on Saturday.<br><br>
 The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, also know as IIT Delhi or IITD, is a public engineering institution located in Delhi, India. The institute is located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi and surrounded by the monuments such as the Qutub Minar and Lotus Temple. It was declared to be Institute of National Importance by Government of India under Institutes of Technology Act. IIT Delhi is one of the two educational institutes in India which have been listed in Quacquarelli Symonds’ (QS) list of top 200 universities globally in 2015.<br><br>
 Since then, his brother Bachoo shifted in with him. He had stepped out of the room and moments later found his brother hanging.<br><br>
Police said that they have found a one page suicide note from his possession and they are investigating into the matter.<br><br>
Police said that they rushed a team to the hostel and the man was taken to hospital, where he was declared brought dead.
DCP (south west) Milind Dumbere said that Maloo attempted committing suicide on Tuesday evening as well, but he was found lying unconscious in time and shifted to Safdarjung hospital, where he was given medication and discharged later. Post this, he was given counselling as well.<br><br>
