    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px"> Madrid: Zinedine Zidane believes the negative reaction to Real Madrid's last-gasp win over Juventus has been "disgraceful, upsetting and deceptive", and borne out of jealousy towards the European champions.

Real sneaked into the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday after English referee Michael Oliver awarded the 12-times champions a controversial penalty in added-on time.<br><br>

Cristiano Ronaldo held his nerve to send his side through 4-3 on aggregate after Juve had staged a remarkable comeback, levelling the tie by leading 3-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu.


Gianluigi Buffon launched a scathing attack on Oliver after the match while sections of the Italian and Spanish press were also criticial of Real's victory.<br><br>

Corriere dello Sport, a daily sports newspaper in Rome, led with the headline 'Che Furto', meaning 'What A Theft', while Sport, the Barcelona daily, carried 'El Robo Del Siglo' on its front page, 'The Theft Of The Century'.<br><br>


"When people talk about it being a robbery I get angry - it is clear what we are doing annoys a lot of people," Zidane said on Saturday.

"There are people that are anti-Real Madrid, but nobody is going to change that. Nobody can change the history of this club, what it has achieved.

"We are the best club in the world and when you're the best club in the world, there is a certain degree of jealousy."<br><br>

Zidane added: "To be honest I think it is disgraceful, upsetting and deceptive. Anyone who says it was a robbery, I really don't agree."

Buffon was sent off for dissent on the pitch and then vented his anger off it too, by saying Oliver lacked personality and should have watched the game at home with his wife.<br><br>

It could mark a dramatic end to Buffon's Champions League career, given the 40-year-old is expected to retire at the end of the season.

"Those were his words," Zidane said. "He was stressed, his feelings were heated. You have to respect his point of view but I think we deserved to qualify for the semi-finals."

Real will now face German champions Bayern Munich in the semis, in a repeat of last year's quarter-final, which Los Blancos won 6-3 on aggregate.<br><br>

    <center><img src="ka5.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center> <br> 
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">Mohali: Punjabi singer Parmish Verma was shot by unidentified assailants on Friday night near his home in Mohali. Police officials said they had rushed to the 'Gaal Ni Kadni' singer's home after they received a phone call from the singer asking for help. In a statement, a top Mohali police official said that the assailants had arrived in a white Toyota Fortuner SUV. The police official said that they were reviewing CCTV footage obtained from the spot as part of the investigation into the incident.<br><br>

Mr Verma was returning home accompanied by a friend and a bodyguard from an event at Chandigarh's Elante mall. There are conflicting reports about the precise sequence of events of the shooting. Initial reports suggested that the singer was shot by the assailants after he had sent his bodyguard home.<br><br>

News agency IANS later reported that a white Hyundai Creta car had followed the singer's Toyota SUV from Chandigarh. The car then stopped in front of Mr Verma's vehicle near Sector 74 in Mohali, which is when the assailants shot at the singer.<br><br>

"Some unidentified persons fired shots at Parmish last night at Sector 91 in Mohali when he was returning home," Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Chahal told news agency PTI.<br><br>
<h1 style="color:#990012"><font face="verdana" size="6px">Punjab: CM Amarinder Singh launches loan waiver scheme for SCs, other poor

    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">Attacking the central government on the issue of Dalits’ reservation and the SC/ST Act, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh Saturday launched a loan waiver scheme for scheduled castes and backwards classes and vowed all efforts to prevent dilution of provisions under the Act.<br><br>

“Our government has put all efforts so that the SC/ST Act’s provisions are not diluted. I also urge the Congress MPs from the state to take up this matter in Parliament,” Captain told a gathering at a state-level function to commemorate the 127th birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar here on Saturday.<br><br>

At the function, the CM launched a debt waiver of up to Rs 50,000 each for the beneficiaries of Punjab Scheduled Castes Land Development and Finance Corporation and Punjab Backward Classes Land Development and Finance Corporation. As much as Rs 45.41 crore has been waived for 14,260 beneficiaries in the first category and Rs 6.59 crore for 1,630 people in the second category. In a token gesture, the CM handed over waiver certificates to 15 people, including 10 from the SC Land Development and Finance Corporation. A total of 650 beneficiaries were given checks on the day.<br><br>

Earlier, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president and Lok Sabha MP from Gurdaspur, Sunil Jakhar, accused the Centre of being anti-Dalit. “By not defending the SC/ST Act in the Supreme Court properly, the (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi government has already attacked the social fabric of the country where two Bharat bandhs have already been observed by both the reserved categories and general castes. They (the BJP) wants to follow the British formula of divide and rule on the basis of caste and creed,” said Jakhar, adding that there is a strong need to stop the BJP from polarising the communities.<br><br>
