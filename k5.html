When organisms change during the course of evolution, often what drives new forms is not genes themselves, but gene regulatio</font></h1><br>

    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px"> what turns genes on and off. A new study identifies the kind of gene regulation most likely to generate evolutionary change.<br><br>

Most modern organisms store genetic information in DNA and transcribe the information from DNA into RNA. Protein "transcription factors" that inhibit or enhance transcription of genes in the DNA are said to regulate gene expression.<br><br>

In a March paper in PNAS, a team in Switzerland at ETH Zürich and the University of Zürich demonstrated that gene regulation by protein transcription factors more readily powers evolutionary change than another form of gene regulation that works at the RNA level.<br><br>

"That really surprised us," said senior author Andreas Wagner, an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute and chairman of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zürich. "It's not self-evident. It's one of those things you just don't know before you look."<br><br>

"New forms of regulation are crucial for a lot of new features of life," said Wagner. "What distinguishes the body plan of humans from that of sea urchins or fruit flies is new kinds of regulation -- turning the right genes on and off at the right time."<br><br>

Previous work by the same team showed that transcription factors show high levels of two key evolutionary traits -- robustness and evolvability. A robust system functions relatively normally even when mutations occur. In contrast, an evolvable system is able to generate new forms or traits in response to new mutations<br><br>

Scientists discover first super salty subglacial lakes in Canadian Arctic</font></h1><br>
  <div id="main">

    <center><img src="ka2.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center> <br> 
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">An analysis of radar data led scientists to an unexpected discovery of two lakes located beneath 550 to 750 metres of ice underneath the Devon Ice Cap, one of the largest ice caps in the Canadian Arctic. They are thought to be the first isolated hypersaline subglacial lakes in the world.<br><br>

"We weren't looking for subglacial lakes. The ice is frozen to the ground underneath that part of the Devon Ice Cap, so we didn't expect to find liquid water," said Anja Rutishauser, PhD student at the University of Alberta, who made the discovery while studying airborne radar data acquired by NASA and The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) to describe the bedrock conditions underneath the Devon Ice Cap. Ice penetrating radar sounding measurements are based on electromagnetic waves that are sent through the ice and reflected back at contrasts in the subsurface materials, essentially allowing scientists to see through the ice.<br><br>

"We saw these radar signatures telling us there's water, but we thought it was impossible that there could be liquid water underneath this ice, where it is below -10C."<br><br>

While there are more than 400 known subglacial lakes in the world, concentrated primarily in Antarctica with a few in Greenland, these are the first found in the Canadian Arctic. And unlike all the others -- which are believed to contain freshwater -- these two appear to consist of hypersaline water. Rutishauser explained that the source of the salinity comes from salt-bearing geologic outcrops underneath the ice.<br><br>

3-D printed active metamaterials for sound and vibration control</font></h1><br>
  <div id="main">

    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">
Researchers have been pushing the capabilities of materials by carefully designing precise structures that exhibit abnormal properties that can control acoustic or optical waves. However, these metamaterials are constructed in fixed geometries, meaning their unique abilities are always fixed. Now, new 3-D printed metamaterial developed by a team led by University of Southern California researchers can be remotely switched between active control and passive states.<br><br>

USC Viterbi School of Engineering Assistant Professor Qiming Wang and Ph.D. student Kun-Hao Yu, along with MIT Professor Nicholas Fang and University of Missouri Professor Guoliang Huang, have developed 3-D printed metamaterials capable of blocking sound waves and mechanical vibrations. Unlike current metamaterials, these can be turned on or off remotely using a magnetic field. Their materials can be used for noise cancellation, vibration control and sonic cloaking, which can be used to hide objects from acoustic waves.<br><br>

"When you fabricate a structure, the geometry cannot be changed, which means the property is fixed. The idea here is, we can design something very flexible so that you can change it using external controls," said Wang, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering.<br><br>

Metamaterials can be used to manipulate wave phenomena such as radar, sound and light and have been used to develop technology such as cloaking devices and improved communication systems. The team's metamaterials are able to control environmental sounds and structural vibrations, which have similar waveforms. By 3-D printing a deformable material containing iron particles in a lattice structure, their metamaterials can be compressed using a magnetic field.<br><br>

"You can apply an external magnetic force to deform the structure and change the architecture and the geometry inside it. Once you change the architecture, you change the property," Wang said. "We wanted to achieve this kind of freedom to switch between states. Using magnetic fields, the switch is reversible and very rapid."<br><br>

The magnetic field compresses the material, but unlike a physical contact force like a metal plate, the material is not constrained. Therefore, when an acoustic or mechanical wave contacts the material, it perturbs it, generating the unique properties that block sound waves and mechanical vibrations of certain frequencies from passing through.<br><br>

The mechanism relies on the abnormal properties of their metamaterials -- negative modulus and negative density. In everyday materials, these are both positive.<br><br>
