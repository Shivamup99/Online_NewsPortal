  <h2><font face="verdana" size="6px">Delhiites May Have To Leave City To Make Room For Garbage: High Court</font></h>
  </font></h1><br>

<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">The court warned authorities of stringent penal action if anyone dies or gets infected by vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.<br><br>
  DELHI:  Anguished over lack of cleanliness and hygiene in parts of Delhi, the Delhi high court said today that the city will die if the situation does not improve as people may have to move out to make room for the increasing garbage.<br><br>

The court warned authorities of stringent penal action if anyone dies or gets infected by vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. It said if immediate action is not taken by the centre, the Delhi government or the civic bodies, it will be forced to take strict action against all of them.<br><br>

At least 12 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi till April 7, according to a municipal report released on Monday, indicating early spread of the vector-borne disease.<br><br>

The high court bench lamented that there appear to be "no sensitivity" towards health and entitlement of citizens to a clean environment.<br><br>

The court said it was concerned with citizens's right to life. "No human or animal should be co-existing with garbage," it said, adding: "This is 21st Century India, you can't make people of Delhi live like this." <br><br>

The bench said it was "high time that those responsible for hygiene and cleanliness are held responsible for their deficiencies"<br><br>

"We see no reason as to why in event of any death caused by vector-borne diseases, persons heading the concerned departments in Union of India, Delhi government and municipal bodies be not charge with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and those who are infected and does not result into a death be charged with section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC as well as other penal provisions," it said.<br><br>
It also observed that every time the court calls senior officials before it, some improvement happens but thereafter, nothing happens.<br><br><br><br><br>

Additional deputy commissioner of police (north east Delhi) RP Meena said the incident was reported around 2 pm on Saturday.<br><br>

COMMENTS"He invited his sister and Atif to settle the issue and carried a loaded pistol. When Atif and his wife reached at the designated spot for the meeting, after some brief talks, Akram shot Atif and fled from there," RP Meena said.<br></font></p></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
