Degree or diploma? IIMs free to choose, says HRD ministry</font></h1><br>

  It is up to Indian Institutes of Managment (IIMs) to decide whether they want to award degrees or diplomas to their postgraduate students, according to officials in the HRD ministry.<br><br>
  It is up to Indian Institutes of Managment (IIMs) to decide whether they want to award degrees or diplomas to their postgraduate students, according to officials in the HRD ministry.<br><br>

Despite the ministry allowing them to grant degrees to their students, IIMs have not yet arrived at a consensus on the matter.<br><br>

“The decision to grant degree or diploma is to be taken by IIMs. They are free to do so. They have created a strong reputation for themselves, and their academic awards including the Post Graduate Diploma (PGDM) are recognised globally. The ministry will not intervene in it,” a senior HRD ministry official said.<br><br>

Parliament had on December 20 passed the IIM Act, empowering the premier management institutes to grant degrees to students.<br><br>

The directors of all the 20 business schools met in the national capital on February 28 to reach a consensus on the issue.<br><br>

IIM Bangalore, IIM Lucknow and IIM Ranchi held their convocation ceremony last month.<br><br>

While IIM Lucknow and IIM Ranchi gave postgraduate diplomas in management or PGDM to their students, IIM Bangalore was the first to award an MBA degree.<br><br>

IIM Udaipur and IIM Indore are also exploring the idea of granting degrees.<br><br>

Earlier, all IIMs were separate bodies registered under the Societies Act. Since societies are not authorised to award degrees, students admitted to their Master’s programme were given a PGDM. Similarly, those pursuing doctoral studies are awarded the title of a “Fellow” at the end of their research.<br><br>

Although the PG diploma and “Fellow” title are recognised by the Association of Indian Universities and the HRD ministry as being equivalent to an MBA and a PhD degree, respectively, the equivalence is not universally accepted, especially for the Fellow programme, which prompted the government to conceive the Act.<br><br></font></p></div>
