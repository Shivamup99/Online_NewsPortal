You are at the center of this stadium, thousands of Vivekananda and thousands of sisters are enjoying the energy of Nivedita. The saffron color on every side is further enhancing this energy. Your blessings of this energy also wanted to get direct income, so when the letter of Swami Vireeshanandji Saraswatiji came three days ago, I was happy to come to you, but there are certain limitations of time from time to time. And you know that the Parliament session is also starting from tomorrow, and therefore it was a bit difficult to get out of here. I am not able to come between you. But in modern science, through modern technology, I have had the privilege of connecting with everyone.<br><br>

Any kind of communication with the younger generation, they always learn something or something, and so I try as much as possible to get more from the youth, talk to them, listen to their experiences. Knowing their hopes, their aspirations, doing some work according to them, and for this, I constantly strive for it.<br><br>

It is my good fortune that I have had the opportunity today to launch this huge youth festival and a monk-devotee conference. Three years ago when you came to Tumkru to receive the blessing of Lord Shiva Swamiji, then I can never forget the affection that was received from the people there, especially the youth. Pujya Shivakumar Swamiji, with the blessings of Lord Vivekanand ji, is devoted to the sacrifice of nation building. Moment of moment, moment, moment of their body, that is, they have annihilated the country. I always pray to God for their better health and longevity.<br><br>

Companions, this is very rare, when the celebration of three great occasions is celebrated together. But in Tumkur, this Triveni festival has also made its divine combination. 25 years of establishment of Ramkrishna Ashram in Tumkuru, 125 years of the address of Swami Vivekanand in Chicago and 150 years of birth of sister Nivedita, these events are very special in itself, I feel like this. In order to immerse the trio of these three occasions, it is a great achievement for thousands of young people of Karnataka to get together here at the Youth Festival. I once again congratulate all of you for this festival, Pujya Swamiji, Ramakrishna Mission, heartily, and salute the superiors.<br><br>

The center point of today's three events is Swami Vivekananda. And we well know that on Karnataka there is a special affection for Swami Vivekanand ji. Prior to moving to the US, he stayed for a few days in Karnataka before going to Kanyakumari. And Swami Vivekanand ji associated our spiritual expansion with the needs of the times. He had added our glorious history to our present. I am very happy that this program of today is being organized as a Sadh-Bhakta Convention with our spiritual expansions and youth festival, together with our present, on the shoulder side, like the railroad tracks today, to carry forward the country. Is thinking for<br><br>

Saints-society is also mobilized all over the country, and the young man also is involved. And here's talk of pilgrimages, so there is talk of technology.Here, there is talk of God and new innovations are also discussed.A model of Spiritual Festival and Youth Festival is evolving in Karnataka.I hope That these events will inspire others across the country, our historical traditions and the present youth power for the future preparations are wonderful.<br><br>

If we look at our country's independence movement, look at that period of nineteenth and twentieth century, you will find that at that time even a joint resolution was found at different levels. This joint resolution was to free the country from the chains of slavery. Then be a saint or a devotee, be a believer or an atheist, a guru or a disciple, a worker or a professional; All the organs of the society joined the same resolution, connected to the same resolution.<br><br>

At that time, our saint society was clearly watching that the divided society among different castes, the divided society in different classes could not match the British. To overcome this weakness, during that time Bhakti movement was going on in different parts of the country, social movement was going on. The country was united through these movements, a campaign was launched to free the country from its internal evils. The commanders of these movements made the common people of the country equal, equal to everyone, gave equal respect to each. Understanding the need of the country, he laid down his spiritual journey inside the nation building journey, dedicated it, dedicated it. He made the medium of service to the service of the people.<br><br>
<img src="sss.jpg" width="800" height="500">

It was almost the same time that a large number of students and professionals from different regions joined the freedom struggle, be lawyers, teachers, scientists, doctors, engineers. These professionals gave new direction to the country's independence movement and after the independence, the foundation of nation building was strengthened.<br><br>

When these two attempts came together, the country stood up intellectually and socially and the united people of India were driven away by overthrowing the British, proving the joint resolution of independence.<br><br>

After many decades of independence, once again the same resolution power is revealed in the country, the same determination power can be seen and seen. And that resolution power is sometimes present in philosophy. Just recently you saw, yesterday we saw in North-East and you saw that the whole country was painted in the color of Holi. But the results of the North-East elections yesterday have once again created a festive atmosphere all over the country.<br><br>

You must think why I am mentioning this thing in this program? I think that I must say the feelings of my heart between you. Look at the election in the North-East tomorrow and the results have come; Who won it, who was defeated, which party won, was the defeat of a party or the victory of the other party; I do not see it with the scales of Jai-defeated political parties.<br><br>

It is important that the whole nation is involved in the happiness of the people of North-East. Such occasions are very rare that any accomplishment of the North-East will become the accomplishment of the country. And today- when we saw that the whole country sat in front of TV in the morning, according to their feelings, according to the dreams of the people of North-East. As if he himself is in the battle for elections, every Indian feels like that.<br><br>

I think that for my northeast brothers, sisters, and the mandate they have given, there is a huge change in themselves. Ramakrishna Mission Ho, be the center of Vivekananda, thousands of activists, devotees of life, are engaged in the work of philanthropy of Saint-North-East, and due to this the people who are sitting here, You know people well. And so I say that the mood of the country that has shown the country after the results of the North-East elections, is the whole of India in the heart of every North-East person connected with their feelings, has given a powerful message to him. For the unity of the country, for an India-the best India, these emotions are very big.<br><br>

Friends, first of all, the policies and decisions were made here that the sense of alienation in the northeast has turned home. People began to feel disconnected from the main stream of faith and non-development. The reason for these problems was also the spirit. In the last four years, our government's policies, decisions, tried to fill the gap, tried to fill the feeling of separation. We resolved the emotional integration of the North-East. And it has been proved by proving it.<br><br>

I have given you a lot of satisfaction in the tribal areas of Tripura, and I want to tell you specially. There are 20 assembly seats in the small state of Tripura. Tribal areas are in dominated areas. And there is an illusion that we are impoverished where there are tribals, there is Maoism, there is naxalism, left wing extremism, many things happen. And by spreading these illusions, there is a constant effort to isolate them. So that those who try to break the country will have a good land there. But yesterday the results of Tripura have set a different example. In the north-east, tribal siblings have denied hatred politics by making one-sided polling in favor of Bharatiya Janata Party.
<br><br>
Sociologists, radicalization answers can be given only by integration. For any section of the country, no class should feel himself cut off from the mainstream, for this it is being endeavored by our government to be determined, but all the countries have to make the mantra of unity stronger. .Josharda is on the table, they are and are doing great fun<br><br>

This resolution, devoted to the formation of comradeship, nation, can be understood better by a message of Swami Vivekanand ji. Swamiji had said-
<p style="color:red"><font face="System">
"Life is short, but the soul is immortal and eternal, and one thing being certain, death, let us take up a great idea and give it to our whole life."

Life is very small, life is uncertain, death is certain. And that's why we should set a resolution and quack our life on it.</font></p><br><br>

Today among thousands of young people, I want to ask all of you this question that what should be a resolution? Many times I see that a young man is suddenly asked what his life's goal is. So he can not answer directly. He is confused with his purpose of life. Friends, when resolution and goals are clear in our lives, then only we will be able to prove anything, the country will be able to give something to humanity. When the resolution is confused, it will be confused, it will not be possible to achieve the goal. After reaching the railway platform, many trains are standing, and you do not know which train to sit in, or you can reach the destination, or you can decide the path of travel.<br><br>

<p style="color:red"><font face="System">Swami Vivekanand ji, he has a very famous statement, and he used to say "take up one idea" Make that one idea your life, think of it, dream of it, live on that idea, let the brain, muscles, nerve, every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone This is the way to success. "</font></p><br><br>

Every young person who came to this Youth Festival today is urged to be clear about his resolve, what he has to do in life, should always be clear by taking it.<br>

Brothers and sisters, today our India is the youngest country in the world. More than 65 percent of the people are under 35 years of age. This immense energy of youth power can change the fate of the country, making the whole country energetic. After the formation of government in 2014 and therefore our government, in keeping with Youth Power, made many decisions to use this energy for nation building and these processes are continuing.<br><br>

You will remember that we came into the government and soon after coming to India, for the future of the country, we were made an independent ministry for skill development of the youth of the country. Previously there was skill development but in the government this 40-50 had to be scattered in the ministries, they were different. Each direction was different too. Sometimes, the direction of each of them was confronting each other. Now a ministry is looking at the work of skill development across the country. Under this Ministry, skill development centers are being opened in every district of the country. Looking at the need of the industry, short term and long term training is being given to the youth. The Prime Minister's money scheme is being run by the government for the youth to start their own business on their own, without getting a bank guarantee loan. As per the monetary policy, about 11 crore people have been lone so far in the country. More than 14.4 million loan has been sanctioned to the youth of Karnataka. Due to this plan, the country has also got around 30 million new entrepreneurs. It is a matter of great importance to my youth that 30 million new entrepreneurs are contributing to the nation's economy in such a short time.

In addition to promoting skill development and self employment, our government has worked to create a market for the products of youngsters.The Government has made a policy change so that the local products should be given priority in the government procurement of the government. Apart from this, another arrangement has been developed, in the name of GEM i.e. Government e Market.Government - Market, through this online platform, now any young man, any woman, any village person made in his own company or in his own house. Whether he wants to provide any services, then if the government needs it then the government does not need co-middlemen, no need for tender, big companies do not need; They can buy things from ordinary human beans. We are also encouraging the State Governments to join this portal to encourage new entrepreneurs in their state. The country's 20 state governments have come up with the central government in this campaign.
<br><br>
Because of the constant efforts of our government, our government has created an environment where the youth can train today according to the industrial needs of the country, doing something on their own and selling their products in the market. How much of this environment is necessary, it can understand the youngsters of Karnataka better and better. Understanding the aspirations of millions of young people like you, the government is also running programs such as Start Up India - Stand Up India.
<br><br>
For the first time, our government has linked employment to Tax Incentive. The companies which are apprenticeship to the youth, are being given tax exemption by the government. The Pprovident Fund of youth is being financed by the government. Youngsters whose companies are limited to the turnover of upto Rs 2 crores, and in which the payment is done in a digitally, they are also being exempted under the tax.
<br><br>
I believe there is no shortage of Sense of Mission among the youth of our country. They want to put their ideas on the ground like innovative solutions so that things are more efficient and economical. That's why our government is doing the job it needs to be encouraged.
<br><br>
Companions, innovation is the basis of a better future. With this thought in our education system, innovation is being done to make a part of school culture. Government has introduced the Atal Innovation Mission - to transform Ideas for children of young age in innovation in schools - AIM So far, more than two thousand and four hundred acal Tinkering Labs have been approved in the country.
<br><br>
The Central Government is working on another very big mission and it is the task of setting up 20 World Class Education institutes in the country. The work of 20 Institutes of Eminence in the country Under this mission, 10 selected institutions of the public sector will be given financial assistance of Rs. 10 thousand crore in a set period. These Institutes of Eminence will bring India back to its place in modern education.
<br><br>
In this budget we have also started a new scheme named RISE. Under this, our government is going to spend Rs 1 lakh crore in the next four years to improve the education system of the country.
<br><br>
The Prime Minister's Research Fellows scheme has also been announced by the government in the budget. Under this, the students of 1000 engineering students of the country who are promising and promising will be given financial assistance of 70 to 80 thousand rupees for five years for the PhD program. .
<br><br>
Considering the needs of the future, keeping in mind the power of our HumanResource, the benefits of many schemes initiated by the Center are equally easy to meet the youth of Karnataka, equally possible. The work being done by the Central Government in the field of Innovation, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, the work being done for this is opening new door for new opportunities for the youth of Karnataka. Especially Smart City Mission has made easy access to the talented youth of Karnataka across the country, ensuring better utilization of their talent.
<br><br>
<p style="color:red"><font face="System">Peoples, sister, Nivedita, once commented that what should be done like that, students of Indian students do not copy any other country, they will not be duplicate and complete themselves. Continuing this point he said,

"Your education should be an education of the heart and the spirit, and of the spirit as much of the brain; It should be a living connection between yourself and your past as well as the modern world! "

That is, it is very necessary to connect between your history, your present and your future. The stronger this connect with your traditions, the more youth in the country will feel strong.</font></p><br><br>

This sense of respect for the brothers and sisters, their traditions, is also seen in the recently launched play by the Central Government-India, Play-India plan. And I say - the one who played that blossomed. For this we have made a major change in policy. To promote the guru-disciple tradition in sports, the government will not only honor the current coach but also the respect of every guru who taught the player to walk with his finger. In the event of winning the International Medal, the earlier Gurus will also be given some part of the respected amount.<br><br>

Keeping in mind this trend of traditions, the indigenous sports like Kabaddi and Kho-Kho are being emphasized in the India program. Under this scheme, by identifying Talent from the corners of the country, the government is trying to give it a modern platform of sports. And the government has decided that by selecting one thousand young players every year, they will be given financial assistance of Rs. 5 lakh each for training between Modern Sports Infrastructure every year.<br><br>

<p style="color:red"><font face="System">Companions, "Student Devo Bhava:" Not only your slogan, we also have the mantra. Rather I would like to add this to your acceptance too - "Yuva Devo Bhava: - Yuva Shakshan Devo Bhava:".</font></p><br>

I consider the youth as equal to the divine power, because I do not have the condition of youth, not a state of age but a mental state, I believe in mental state. Young people just do not think that what was good before, that was better. Young people think that by learning from the old, how to make the present and the future better. That is why he works to change the country, attempts to change the world. The youth wants that the future - better and stronger than both the present and the past.<br><br>

That's why I salute the power of the youth of the country again. An India-best Bharat- You have to hear the words. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel: The work of unifying the country was done. To make India the best India, it is the responsibility of the people. And so I would like to have so many young people sitting here - many of you people who would like to learn French language; There will be many of you who would like to learn Spanish language; it's a good thing. It is a good thing to learn any language in the world. But what ever arises in our mind is that the country, such a large country, 100 languages, 1700 dialect; 10-12 languages ​​We also learn, 5-50 sentences to learn the language of our country. Learn to sing two-four songs of another state's language. I think this power is very important to unite the country and we can develop it as a spontaneous nature. I also say in broken language - but as soon as some things in Kannada began to touch your heart somewhere. You did not see in it that Modiji's words were correct or not, whether grammar was right or not, you thought that how much idiom is working to connect with us. It has the power to unite the country. It connects the country.<br><br>

From the determination of the journey of success to the country that is going on, New India is moving forward to fulfill the dream, its big responsibility is on the youth of my country. With the very best wishes of the future, I once again call young people, we remember Swami Vivekanand ji. We remember sister Nivedita. Look at Shiva in the service of Lord Shiva - this is a philosophy in our country - whether it is a clean India, save your daughter-daughter-daughter, whether it is the services of the elderly for the elderly, the farmers will get the latest technology To help you get help - by taking a job we also add ourselves. And I believe that all the young people are the holy land of these saints - great saints and Tumkuru, where such senior saints are sitting; You will walk by taking a new inspiration from such land.<br><br>

All of you Narendra Modi App, you will be connected. And I also feel like I join you. Join me with the Narendra Modi app. Talk to me, convey your feelings to me. And I tell you today - It is fine that I can not speak Kannada language, I had to speak in Hindi. But you will have to think that these things are to be seen in Kannada, to listen - so I tell my team that whatever I have spoken to you on the Narendra Modi app, the main parts of it, keep it in the Kannada language too. Give it So that you can hold my thoughts in Kannada language, my language in your language and take this matter forward.
<br><br>
I congratulate Ramkrishna-Vivekananda Ashram for the event, ten times for the Triveni Sangam, today and I salute all the saints here. I salute Sivagiri Mutt, and you very much like all the youngsters.
