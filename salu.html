Decoding The Mystery Behind Bollywood’s Never Ending Support For ‘Macho Mard’ Salman Khan</font></h1><br>

Salman Khan is India's favorite macho mard. Often touted as a man with a big heart, Khan is the gym-trainer and acting coach of lesser Bollywood mortals like Arjun Kapoor and Sooraj Pancholi, the money-making golden goose of producers and the ultimate bro of an entire section of Indian men who believe bulging muscles is what makes ‘manhood’. Khan is also a convicted individual who is currently looking at a jail term of five years. <br><br>

For the past few days, there was no escaping the news that Salman Khan has been sentenced to a five-year prison time for killing two blackbucks in Kankani Village, near Jodhpur, in October 1998.<br><br>

Thousands of articles and an inordinate amount of airtime was dedicated by the media to cover every aspect of this news. One big question that was being tossed around was-- what will happen to Khan's upcoming films -- Race 3, Kick 2, Dabangg 3 and Bharat-- if he goes to jail?<br><br>

Over the last few decades, this question has resurfaced every time a big Bollywood actor like Khan has faced lawsuits that can send him to jail. While it is pertinent to ask how much money do producers stand to lose if Khan goes to prison, the more important question here is why have Bollywood filmmakers continued to invest in Khan, who has lawsuits pending against him which, if proven, can put him in jail jeopardizing their films?<br><br>
The temptation to cast Khan is understandable to a certain extent. With his sheer star power, the actor can turn any film into a money-minting machine. In most cases, it is truly a miraculous feat to achieve given the films he acts in have no scripts to speak of, often defy logic and lack content.<br><br>

However, Khan isn't the only actor in the industry who has the superpower of turning a crappy film into a goldmine. If you think of it -- from Shah Rukh Khan to Akshay Kumar-- there are several Bollywood superstars who can play the macho mard onscreen with equal flare (well, almost!) and strike box office gold with ease. And the good news is that they neither have lawsuits with such serious charges against them nor do they have to serve a jail term in near future. Then why are Bollywood producers still so hung up on bhai?<br><br>
