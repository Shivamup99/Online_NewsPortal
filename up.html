  <h1><font face="verdana" size="6px">
    UP Election 2017: Amid 'abki baar, BJP sarkar' mood, race for second place is open to SP and BSP</font></h1><br>
    <div id="main">

    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">
      At a paan (betel) shop at Hazratgamj in Lucknow, two persons were leisurely having their early morning paan and discussing politics. “Looks like the BJP is surging ahead," one of them said and then started giving his perspective. While they were still talking, an auto stopped and the driver rushed out to buy some gutka. The driver overheard the conversation and, without wasting a moment, came out with his verdict, “Bhaiya aisa hai ki BJP jeet raha hai nahi balki BJP jeet gayee, aap meri baat ganth bandh lo. (Brother it’s like that, BJP is not winning but it has won. You mark my words)”.<br><br>

Within the next few seconds, he was gone, at the speed with which had come but leaving paan, gutka and cigarette for lingering thought to all present there, more so, because his words were of an ordinary voter, not of a BJP worker.<br><br>

What was amusing was the degree of finality and conviction in his statement. He is not waiting for the 11 March verdict. For him and several others like him, results have almost been pre-decided and the results date, counting of votes would be for actual numbers.<br><br>

While travelling through various parts of the state, Firstpost met and talked at length with ordinary people inside villages, at small roadside chai-paan shops, at chaupals, at nukkads, at their kuchha-pucca houses and in semi-urban areas. The enthusiasm and vigour that people displayed for BJP among people across social and caste strata, as also of varying age, was not matched by those supportive of the BSP and SP. The sense that one got for a BJP victory was like that for the SP in 2012 and for BSP in 2007.<br><br>

In fact, the conviction that was seen from sections of voters across Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bhagpat, Shamli , Kairana, Kannauj, Azamgarh, Baranas, Jaunpur, Raebareli, Sultanpur, Amethi, Allahabad, Lucknow et al for the BJP was somewhat similar (to a bit lesser degree) to what one had seen when winds of change were blowing in Delhi and in parliamentary elections – Phool chhap (Lotus) is favoured over cycle, elephant and hand.<br><br>

At a ramshakale tea shop ahead of Unchhar, a CRPF jawan, who was in a civilian dress along with two others but was identifiable as Jawan by his looks and a Tavera MUV with Police marking parked nearby, was most forthcoming. He belonged to Hardoi, another district in UP and was on duty travelling to various other parts. He said, “This has now become a Hindu-Muslim election. I have been talking to my family, friends and other people who come across me when I am off duty, I get a feeling that BJP is coming to power with thumping majority.” On further questioning he revealed that he is Kurmi by caste, a non-Yadav OBC.<br><br>

BJP’s stress on non-Yadav OBCs has worked very favourably. It has succeeded in conveying a message that Akhilesh Yadav’s SP government cared only for Yadav and Muslims – all posts, recruitment and prize postings were meant for Yadavs and all welfare schemes meant even alliance with Congress meant to lure Muslims, Kabristan versus Samshan theme.
