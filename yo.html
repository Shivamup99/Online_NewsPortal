 UP by-election result 2018: BJP downplays defeat, Opposition says loss shows voters' anger at saffron party </font></h1><br>

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered defeats in Gorakhpur — a seat vacated by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath — and Phulpur, a constituency won by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in 2014, to the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav led-Samajwadi Party and Mayawati-helmed Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Following the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha bypoll results announced on Wednesday, the BJP tried to downplay its defeat while Opposition parties were quick to attack the saffron party.<br><br>

Following the unexpected loss, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-election results were a "lesson". He cited over-confidence and the inability to understand the pact between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as prime reasons for the BJP's defeat.<br><br>


The fact that the BJP lost both the seats — Gorakhpur was vacated by Adityanath and Phulpur by his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya — was a reason for review, the chief minister added.<br><br>

"When the candidates were declared, the SP, BSP and Congress were not together. They had not joined hands then. But suddenly in the middle of the election, the SP and the BSP forged an electoral understanding," he told the media from his residence.<br><br>

The chief minister, who has represented Gorakhpur in the Lok Sabha five times, said local issues led to the party's poor performance in by-elections, not the policies of the Centre.<br><br>

The BJP at the national level also tried to play down its defeat saying that people tend to vote on local factors in these elections as their results have no bearing on the stability of either the central or state governments. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao claimed that voters seem to want to bring some amount of "political equilibrium" by giving encouragement to defeated parties as the saffron party has been winning Assembly .<br><br>

"In General Elections, people vote to elect a government and the BJP has always been the favourite as people want guarantee of good governance which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought to politics. Bypolls have no impact on stability of a government whether at the Centre or state," he said. However, senior BJP leaders such as Amit Shah kept mum about the party's defeat.<br><br>

Meanwhile BJP's state chief in Karnataka, BS Yeddyurappa hit out at the Congress for being "decimated" in the bypolls and said the BJP will ensure a similar fate for the Siddaramaiah-led government in the upcoming Assembly election. He also said in a tweet that in "the arena of opportunistic politics, sworn enemies became allies", referring to the Samajwadi Party-BSP alliance.<br><br>

The party's defeat, in Phulpur and its bastion Gorakhpur, is likely to send BJP's top brass to the drawing board, as the country's most populous state are central to its strategy for winning the general elections in 2019.<br><br>

Akhilesh Yadav thanks Mayawati for support,

Buoyed by victory in the bypolls, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Wednesday it was a mandate against both the central and state governments and the results will give a new direction to the national politics.<br><br>

He credited BSP chief Mayawati and allies Nishad Party and Peace Party as well as the Left parties for the victory. The Samajwadi Party chief was profuse in expressing his gratitude towards Mayawati, who was once his party's bitterest rival in the state.<br><br>

"Foremost, I want to thank BSP leader Mayawati for her and her party's support in this important fight," he said. Yadav even drove to the BSP leader's residence and expressed his gratitude to her. While it not known what transpired at the meeting, party insiders believed the two leaders discussed a grand alliance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Mayawati is yet to<br><br>

After his party wrested both the seats from the formidable BJP, Yadav also said the elections were a "mandate on both the governments at the Centre and the state...people have come together to bring BJP's burey din (bad days)".<br><br>

A government that troubles people is pulled down and this government has created problems and led to fear in the people, Yadav added.<br><br>

Terming the bypolls a victory of social justice, Yadav said the BJP talked about loan waiver for farmers, jobs for the unemployed but GST and demonetisation had created an adverse atmosphere and the Constitution was flouted in a big way.
