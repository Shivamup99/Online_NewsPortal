  SC pulls up Delhi Development Authority over sealing drive, says it is worried only about traders, not common man</font></h1><br>

  New Delhi:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Delhi Development Authority over the sealing drive in the national capital, observing that the housing authority was not concerned with the common people of the city but worried only about traders.<br><br>

The top court said the DDA does not notice people until they come out in the streets.<br><br>

The scathing remarks by a bench comprising justices MB Lokur and Deepak Gupta came after the counsel of the DDA informed the court that traders in the national capital have been staging protests against the sealing drive run under the supervision of the apex court- appointed monitoring committee.<br><br>

"You (DDA) are working under tremendous pressure. DDA is not concerned about common people, they do not concern you. Are common people of Delhi irrelevant to you. For you only traders are your concern but not the common people," the bench observed.<br><br>

If people engaged in electricity theft staged protests, then will the concerned authority waive off the penalties under pressure, the court asked.<br><br>

"If people don't stage protest they don't come into your notice. You should strike a balance between traders and common people. You should first look after the interest of common people then you should look after the interest of traders," the bench observed.<br><br>

Counsel for the DDA said that it is looking after the interest of the common people but was just informing about the protests staged by the traders.<br><br>

"Then it means if you are not trader, DDA will not recognise you," the top court said.<br><br>

The apex court said that it would consider the reports of the DDA, Municipal Corporations and other concerned parties after two weeks.<br><br>

On 6 March, the apex court had stayed any "further progress" in amending the Delhi Master Plan 2021 to protect unauthorised construction from the ongoing sealing drive in the national capital, sternly observing that 'dadagiri' (bullying tactics) must stop.</font></p></div><br>
