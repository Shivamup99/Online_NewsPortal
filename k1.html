<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">Huawei P20 Pro which was announced in Paris on 27 March is all set to make its way to India if the company's social media handles are to be believed.<br><br>

Huawei's Twitter account has started teasing the launch of the P20 Pro in India. It's India handle tweeted this animation with the hashtag #HuaweiP20.<br><br>From the tweet above it is not clear if the Chinese telecom giant will be launching the Huawei P20, P20 Pro or both the devices. The animation does show a DSLR which transforms into a smartphone silhouette but without giving away much.<br><br>

As of now, we do not know the exact dates when the company plans to launch the device in India. According to GSMArena, it will most likely be the last week of April. There is no indication on the price tag as well, but considering the P20 Pro costs around €899 abroad, we can expect a price point which is on the higher side.<br><br>


The P20 Pro features a 6.1-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2240 pixel and an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The P20 Pro also gets Huawei's Hisilicon Kirin 970 chipset along with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage. To keep everything chugging smoothly, the Pro also features a 4,000 mAh battery.<br><br>

As for the camera of the P20 Pro which is the biggest highlight of the device, it sports a triple rear camera setup which includes a 40 MP f/1.7 primary sensor, along with a 20 MP monochrome sensor as well as an 8 MP telephoto sensor. The camera optics on the phone has also been co-engineered by Leica. The Huawei P20 Pro also gets a 24 MP f/2.0 front-facing camera for selfies.<br><br>

The phone will be available in four colours — Midnight Blue, Graphite Black, Pink Gold and Twilight.

Here's our first look at the Huawei P20 Pro.<br><br>


  <h1 style="color:#990012"><font face="verdana" size="7px">Apple is working on a gold coloured variant of the iPhone X: Report</font></h1><br>
  
<div id="main">
    <center><img src="u2.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center><br><br>
<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">Apple is reportedly working on a gold-colour variant of premium iPhone X as seen in recent photos published by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).<br><br>
.
"This seems a little too good to be true but the FCC appears to have published photos of a gold iPhone X. Dated from last September and released earlier in April, these photos show an iPhone X unmistakably in an unreleased gold finish," 9to5Mac reported late on 13 April.<br><br>

The prototype iPhone X has a rich gold stainless steel frame and a lighter gold glass back that appears to match the gold colour in iPhone 8.<br><br>

"The photo annotations do include reference to an 'LCD display' which is a little strange as the iPhone X uses an OLED panel. Other than that, it resembles an iPhone X in every way," the report added.<br><br>

The documents filed with the FCC reportedly suggest the photos were taken as much as several months ahead of the iPhone X unveiling in September 2017.<br><br>

Given the timing of the document, it is likely that the iPhone-maker planned on releasing the iPhone X in three colours, gold, silver, and space gray, however, it was ultimately forced to shelve the gold colour option ahead of release due to production issues according to MacRumors.<br><br>

<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">
Canon India on Friday launched EOS M50 — a new mirrorless camera for the millennials in India. Canon EOS M50 is priced at Rs 61,995 for the single kit option.<br><br>

Canon EOS M50 features DIGIC 8 image processor to ensure better picture quality and comes with 4K movie shooting capability.<br><br>


Equipped with an improved 'dual pixel CMOS AF', the lightweight portable camera with 24.1-megapixel APS-C sized CMOS sensor will help users shoot ultra-high-definition movies even under low-light conditions.<br><br>

With the touch and drag AF (auto focus), users are also able to select and move the AF frame via touch panel while looking through the built-in 2.36 million dot electronic viewfinder (EVF).<br><br>

“India is an evolving market and so are the demands and expectations of the customers. EOS M50 strengthens our commitment to the mirrorless segment. This product is a result of our ‘consumer-first’ approach,” Kazutada Kobayashi, president and CEO, Canon India, told reporters.<br><br>

The '4K Frame Grab' function allows for high-resolution images to be extracted from the footage taken. Additionally, with combination IS lenses, users can expect reduced camera shake during movie shooting.<br><br>
<h1 style="color:#990012"><font face="verdana" size="6px">Airtel is offering 30GB of free data for 30 days on upgrading to a 4G smartphone</font></h1><br>
  
<div id="main">
    <center><img src="u5.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center><br><br>
<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">
Telecom major Bharti Airtel said on 13 April that it will offer 30 GB free data to its customers who will upgrade from 2G or 3G handsets to 4G smartphones.<br><br>

Prepaid customers will get 1 GB data free every day for 30 days in addition to the pack they opt for, while postpaid customers will get the same amount of data (with rollover) in their first bill cycle apart from their plan benefits, an Airtel statement said.<br><br>

"While 4G smartphones are fast becoming the norm, for millions of customers with feature phones/3G devices the upgrade to a 4G smartphone is a big decision and a long-term investment," Bharti Airtel CMO Vani Venkatesh said.<br><br>

The initiative complements Airtel's Mera Pehla Smartphone programme, under which Airtel has partnered mobile handset manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola, Lava, and Intex among others to create an open ecosystem of affordable 4G smartphones.
