<div id="main">

<p><font face="cambria">Manu Bhaker secured glory for India on Saturday at the ISSF Junior World Cup in Sydney by winning the gold medal in individual 10m Air Pistol and then the team event. In an intense matchup that went right down to the last shot, Bhaker edged Thailand’s Kanyakorn Hirunphoem for the glory. In so doing, she added to her gold medal won at the ISSF World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico. Incidentally, even in Mexico, Bhaker had won gold on the last shot. India tasted success in the 10m Air Pistol men’s event too with Gaurav Rana winning a silver medal while Anmol Jain bagged the bronze. To close off a great day, India won the team trap mixed team silver medal.<br><br>

Bhaker finished with a total of 235.9 points while Hirunphoem — who previously wrote a new Qualification World Record with 576 points — took silver with 234.9. The podium was then completed by People’s Republic of China’s Lu Kaiman who posted a score of 214.2.<br><br>

The 16-year-old Bhaker lead the showdown by 2.2 points before firing six consecutive shots outside the 10th ring which put her one point behind Hirunphoem with two shots left. At this crucial and nervous juncture, Bhaker did just about enough with shots of 9.6 and 9.8 to overtake her rival who dropped her game when it mattered with a final shot of 7.9.<br><br>

Bhaker, Devanshi Rana and Mahima Turhi Agrawal brought India on top of the team podium, while Xiao, Lu and Li Xue won silver for China. Thailand’s Hirunphoem, Luxciga Srinitivoravong and Warunyapha Kaewngoen took the team bronze.When Manu Bhaker asked her father to get her a pistol, one month after talking up the sport, Ram Kishan Bhaker, a chief engineer in the Merchant Navy, wondered if the investment of Rs 1.5 lakh would be really worth it. Manu had won medals in boxing, skating, thang ta — a Manipuri martial art — and tennis at the national and international level before deciding to pursue shooting as a 14-year-old. On Sunday, she showed she had made the right decision by taking up shooting.<br><br>

Bhaker, all of 16 and making her ISSF World Cup debut, was competing against experienced shooters, those who have won medals at this level of competition in the 10 metre air pistol.<br><br>

She was up against Mexico’s Alejandra Zavala, the local shooter who is a two-time medallist and France’s Celine Goberville, who has three medals at World Cups. Greece’s Rio Olympics gold medallist in the 10 metre pistol, Anna Korakaki, was also in the final. But with a 10.8, the second- highest possible score, in the final shot for a total of 237.5, the teenager from Goria village near Jhajjar pipped Zavala (237.1) and Goberville (217) to win gold — India’s fourth medal at this World Cup.<br><br>

Another Indian, Yashaswini Singh Deswal, missed out on a medal, finishing fourth with 196.1.<br><br></font></p>
