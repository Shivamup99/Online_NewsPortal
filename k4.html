    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">When Pankaj Tripathi found out that he won a Special Mention for Newton at the 65th National Film Awards, he was quite surprised. Stating that he was absolutely not aware that he was even in the running for the biggest film awards in India, the actor exclusively shared his feelings with indianexpress.com.<br><br>

Tripathi, who was part of films like Newton, Bairelly Ki Barfi, Anaarkali of Aarah, Kaalakaandi, Fukrey Returns, Munna Michael, Coffee with D and Gurgaon in 2017, says he has finally received his big award. Sharing how it was actor Saurabh Shukla who broke the news to him, Tripathi said, “It was a big surprise for me too. I got to know about it after half an hour. I had left my phone in the room and was having breakfast in my hotel. Then, Saurabh Shukla came and told me that I got a National Award. I asked him ‘how do you know?’ He said, news has come and he came looking for me. By that time my phone had 100 missed calls.”<br><br>

Pankaj Tripathi played a paramilitary officer in Newton, which also starred Rajkummar Rao. The movie, based on the electoral system of India, has also won the National Award for Best Hindi Film.<br><br>

  Expresso, Episode 12: There’s a lot of beauty in ageing gracefully. I don’t think your aim has to be to look younger, says Rani Mukerji</font></h1><br>
  <div id="main">

    <center><img src="ja3.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center> <br> 
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">Rani Mukerji turned a proud 40 this March. In a befitting celebration of sorts, Hichki, featuring her as Naina Mathur, a teacher afflicted by Tourette Syndrome, released the same month and went on to hit the right notes in terms of box-office profitability and audience reaction. Significantly, during the course of our conversation about all things under the sun, Mukerji announced her milestone birthday that was coming up, surely a first of sorts as far as female actors are concerned. <br><br>On being asked if women put themselves under great pressure to look young, she says, “For me, age is beautiful. When you are aging, you are growing up with so many experiences, so many memories. You can’t get the wisdom if you are young and what is the fun trying to look young in a non-organic way when you have already seen your youth? That’s the natural youth that you have passed and you have enjoyed that phase. You have to enjoy each age in your life. I have become who I am today because I have come to this age.<br><br> There’s a lot of beauty in aging gracefully. I don’t think your aim has to be to look younger. As an actor I do believe that if I were to play a role—I can be challenged to play a 60-year-old, I can also be challenged to play a 20-year-old.”<br><br>

      I quit making Hindi films after Bandit Queen because the quality of films made here was very bad. But the last 10 days of watching Indian cinema, specially the regional films, has stunned me. Movies made in Assam are going to the Cannes Film Festival,” said filmmaker Shekhar Kapur in his opening address at a press meet to announce the winners of the 65th National Film Awards in Delhi. The remarks by Kapur, who headed the jury for the prestigious awards, was a sign of things to come. Over the next one hour, regional films and filmmakers registered their presence in a big way among the winners in 33 categories in the Feature Film section.<br><br>

    It was also an emotional day for Bollywood, as late actor Sridevi bagged the Best Actress award for the revenge drama Mom, while actor-turned-politician Vinod Khanna — who passed away last year — was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema. Kapur told the media he wished he had worked with Khanna at least once.<br><br>

    In perhaps a breakthrough moment for Assamese cinema, Rima Das’ directorial venture, Village Rockstars, was named the Best Feature Film. Set in her own village, Chhaygaon, near Guwahati, Village Rockstars is the story of “poor but amazing children” who live a fun-filled life. Das also won the Best Editing award for the film, which bagged Bhanita Das the Best Child Artist honour. The film also won the Best Location Sound Recordist award. It is after 29 years that an Assamese film has won the Best Feature film award; Jahnu Barua’s Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai won the award in 1987.<br><br>

Another big winner of the day was 19-year-old Riddhi Sen, who bagged the Best Actor award for the Bengali film Nagarkirtan. The film also won the Best Make-up award and a Special Jury award. Sen also featured in the 2016 Oscar-nominated film Lion, besides doing small roles in Kahaani and Parched.<br><br>

Amit Masurkar’s Newton won the Best Hindi Film honour, while actor Pankaj Tripathi won a Special Mention for his performance in the film, which revolves around a young government clerk who is sent for election duty to a Maoist-controlled region. Responding to the news, Tripathi, who played a cynical CRPF officer, Aatma Singh, in Newton, said, “I am absolutely delighted. I had no idea I was even in the running… My director and co-actors made it so easy for me to act in this film.” The film was sent as India’s official entry for the Oscars but did not make it to the shortlist.<br><br>

Shah Rukh Khan’s TED Talks India Nayi Soch renewed for three seasons</font></h1><br>
  <div id="main">

    <center><img src="ja7.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center> <br> 
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">We love to watch Shah Rukh Khan, be it at the theaters or on the television. So when he came back as the host of TED Talks India Nayi Soch, the audience welcomed him wholeheartedly. The first season, which featured speakers delivering inspiring and informative talks in TED’s signature style of 18 minutes or less, drew an astounding 96 million viewers and hence, the makers have decided to renew the Hindi-language TV and digital series hosted by Shah Rukh Khan for three more seasons.<br><br>

In a link shared by TED Talks, SRK said, “I believe passionately that India is brimming with brave and brilliant ideas—and that those ideas have never mattered more. This program features India’s finest storytellers in a surprising blend of entertainment, inspiration and intellectualism, and I‘m more committed than ever to spread their ideas to my country and the rest of the world.”
<br><br>
Star TV CEO and Chairman Uday Shankar said: “Star TV is committed to developing programming that goes beyond pure entertainment to inspire and educate our massive audience. Both the critical response and the tremendous viewer love for this series were key factors in our decision to bring Ted Talks India: Nayi Soch back for at least three more seasons.”<br><br>
