<font face="cambria">SAINT-DENIS, France (Reuters) - France threw away a two-goal lead as they slumped to a 3-2 home defeat to Colombia in a friendly at the Stade de France on Friday, less than three months before the World Cup.<br><br>

Les Bleus were 2-0 up midway through the first half thanks to goals by Olivier Giroud and Thomas Lemar, but Luis Muriel halved the deficit before the break with Radamel Falcao and Juan Quintero scoring in the second half.<br><br>

Before kickoff, there was a minute’s silence in memory of the three people who were killed in southwestern France by a gunman who held up a car, fired on police and seized hostages in a supermarket earlier on Friday.<br><br>

France started with N’Golo Kante and Blaise Matuidi as holding midfielders, Paul Pogba being left on the bench because of a muscle problem and a lack of playing time at Manchester United, according to assistant coach Guy Stephan.<br><br>


Pogba, however, came on as a second half substitute but had little impact.

Les Bleus enjoyed most of the possession and they were rewarded in the 11th minute when Giroud scored his 30th international goal as he knocked the ball in after David Ospina mishandled Lucas Digne’s cross from the left.</font><br><br><br><br>
