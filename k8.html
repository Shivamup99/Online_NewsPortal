After creating a flutter with their wedding, IAS couple Tina Dabi and Athar Amir Khan hosted a grand wedding reception in Delhi on Saturday.<br><br>

While the groom was wearing a golden sherwani with fetching pagdi, the bride was dressed in wine-coloured lehanga and golden dupatta.<br><br>

Who’s who of the Indian politics were in attendance to bless the young couple.

Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad were seen congratulating the IAS couple.<br><br>

This is their third wedding function. The 2016 batch IAS officers had got married at a simple court ceremony in Jaipur. After that they had a beautiful destination wedding in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam also. <br><br>

While the second function was in groom’s home state, the third function happened to be in bride’s home town – Delhi.

The proud parents of the young couple were also seen during the function.<br><br>
Soon after the topping the prestigious UPSC exams, Dabi was hailed as the epitome of gender equality.<br><br>

Topping the list in her first attempt, Dabi graduated from the Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.

Dabi was followed by Athar Aamir Ul Shafi Khan of Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district.<br><br>

But it was the love story between Dabi and Khan that made the two a dream couple. 

Many said that though Khan lost out to Dabi in the UPSC race, but at the end he won her heart.<br><br>

After Uddhav’s threat to CM, MNS chief promises support to farmers opposing the Rs 3-trillion project in Ratnagiri.<br><br>

Could the warring Thackeray cousins find common ground in the Nanar refinery project? Farmers from villages where the Rs 3-trillion refinery is planned to be set up in Ratnagiri district met MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday, asking for support to their agitation against the mega refinery.<br><br>

Raj is said to have assured them of full support and a visit to Nanar soon.
In his vitriolic attack in party mouthpiece Saamna, Uddhav had called Fadnavis “spineless” and a “traitor” for going back on his supposed promise of ensuring that the project would not be “thrust upon the people”. He said his party would not allow the project to take off “under any circumstance”. “It looks like the Centre has not paid heed to the chief minister, who should have remained adamant and got the project scrapped.”<br><br>

The pillory came two days after a consortium of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd signed an MoU with state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) for setting up “India’s largest refinery and petroleum complex” in Ratnagiri.<br><br>

Political support for the agitation against the project has been growing. Former chief minister and Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha founder Narayan Rane, who recently entered the Rajya Sabha through a BJP nomination, is also opposed to the project. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has asked the government to look for an alternative site for the refinery.<br><br>

Adefensive Fadnavis has said that the MoU has been misunderstood, and that it was not about the Nanar project but the oil refinery on the western coast. He has asserted that the government would go ahead with the project regardless of opposition. He also said he would persuade Uddhav and Rane and the protesting farmers to give up their resistance.<br><br>

Once built, the refinery will be the largest single location refinery complex in the world with a capacity of 60 million tonne.<br><br>
