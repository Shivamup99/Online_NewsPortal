Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) rode on Nitish Rana's all-round show and Sunil Narine's whirlwind 19-ball 50 to beat Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) by four wickets in the Indian Premier League (IPL) clash on Sunday. In front of a packed Eden Gardens and co-owner Shah Rukh Khan, part-time off-spinner Rana (2/11) picked up the big wickets of AB de Villiers and skipper Virat Kohli in successive deliveries to reduce the visitors to 127/4 in 14.3 overs. Later, Mandeep Singh's 18-ball 37 helped RCB to a challenging 176/7, but mystery spinner Narine -- used effectively as a destructive opener by KKR since last season -- made light of the target with a fiery 19-ball 50 (4x4, 5x6) along with Rana who scored a vital 25-ball 34 to steer the hosts over the line with seven balls to spare.<br><br>

Narine brought up his fifty in 17 balls only to perish two balls later without adding to the tally, his wicket pocketed by Umesh Yadav.<br><br>

While Narine and vice captain Robin Uthappa (13) associated for a 49-run stand for the second wicket, newly appointed skipper Dinesh Karthik, who was unbeaten on 35 off 29 balls, joined hands with Rana for a 55-run partnership for the fourth wicket.<br><br>

For RCB, Yadav (2/27) bowled well to bag the wickets of Narine and Uthappa (13) while English pacer Chris Woakes (3/36) was the pick of the bowlers, picking up the wickets of big-hitting Australian opener Chris Lynn (5), Rinku Singh (6) and Andre Russell (15).<br><br>

Earlier, veterans De Villiers (44) and opener Brendon McCullum (43) batted well for the three-time finalists before Mandeep's cameo.<br><br>

KKR took wickets at regular intervals but in the last over, Mandeep's pyrotechnics guided RCB to a fighting total.<br><br>

As many as 16 runs were leaked in the final over by Vinay Kumar who had a forgettable comeback for KKR. Two wickets also fell in that over.<br><br>

De Villiers was at his imperious best, his 23-ball 44 laced with five sixes and one four. McCullum too looked good for his 27-ball 43 at the start.<br><br>

De Villiers and Kohli (31) stitched together a third-wicket stand of 64 runs off just 36 balls.<br><br>

KKR, however, were off to a bad start as Vinay Kumar (2/30) leaked 14 runs in the first over, McCullum flicking him down the leg side for a four in the very first ball.<br><br>

The visitors lost Quinton De Kock (4) early, the South African wicketkeeper-batsman trying to reverse sweep Piyush Chawla (1/31) and picking out Vinay Kumar at the short third man.<br><br>

McCullum and Kohli then engineered a 45-run stand for the second wicket.<br><br>

But just when the visitors were looking steady with McCullum looking in fine touch and Kohli at ease playing second fiddle, Narine (1/30) got rid of the dangerous Kiwi with a shortish offbreak that dislodged the stumps.<br><br>

In came de Villiers and took the bowlers to the cleaners in his trademark fashion. The 34-year-old smashed Kuldeep Yadav for two consecutive sixes in the 10th over and then hit Mitchell Johnson for a four and a six, two overs later.<br><br>

De Villiers survived a Decision Review System in the 12th over when the umpire gave him caught behind but reviews showed the ball missing the bat. He was then on 23.<br><br>

In just 27 balls, the pair brought up the 50-run partnership before Rana got the back of the duo in successive balls. De Villiers mistimed Rana and Johnson took the catch between long on and deep mid-wicket. Kohli was yorked.<br><br>

Sarfraz Khan, who was retained by the franchise, managed just six runs with Johnson (1/30) taking his wicket while Mandeep and Woakes (5) fell to Vinay in the last over.<br><br>
