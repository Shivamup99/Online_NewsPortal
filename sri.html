<h2 style="color:blue"><font face="tahoma">State honours for Sridevi's funeral, procession among largest recorded in Mumbai; </font></h2><br>
<p><font face="Sitka Heading">
Maharashtra government accorded full state honours for the funeral of Sridev which included draping her body in the national tricolour, elaborate arrangements by the Mumbai Police and a gun salute before the cremation.<br><br>

In terms of sheer numbers, Sridevi's funeral is estimated to have attracted the highest number of mourners, ranking on par with the previous biggest funeral processions of the legendary singer Mohammed Rafi (July 1980: around a million mourners), and India's first superstar Rajesh Khanna (July 2012: a little less than a million mourners).<br><br>
<div id="demo">
The other big funerals of non-political personalities in Mumbai included those of Raj Kapoor (June 1988) and Vinod Khanna (April 2017).<br><br>

The procession was led by several family members, close relatives, friends and even neighbours of the Green Acres society where the family lived in Lokhandwala Complex<br><br>

Sridevi 'looked like a sleeping beauty', says social worker who helped with repatriation of Sridevi's body from Dubai<br><br>
 
Ashraf Thamarassery was among the handful of people who saw Sridevi for the last time before her mortal remains were embalmed and taken to Mumbai in a private jet on Tuesday. "She looked like she was sleeping peacefully ... a sleeping beauty," 44-year-old Ashraf, from Kozhikode district in north Kerala, said.<br><br>
 
He said the 54-year-old Bollywood icon's face did not look much different than how he had seen her on screen and in photographs. There was no wound on her head as reported by a section of the media, he said.<br>
 
<p style="color:red">Ashraf is known as the 'Friend of the Dead' in the UAE for assisting the repatriation of over 4,700 bodies of expatriates from across the world during the past 18 years. He offers his service free of cost. Ashraf said he was among the few who were present at the embalming room.</p><br>
 
Sridevi was wrapped in three white cotton sheets. She was taken in an ordinary wooden coffin that costs Dh 1,840 (approx Rs 32,000), Ashraf, who owns a garage in Ajman, said. The embalming certificate issued by the Dubai Health Authority bears Ashraf's name</font></p><br><br>
