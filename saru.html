Shah Rukh Khan's new figure will be showcased beside other iconic celebrities in a special interactive and entertaining themed zone at Madame Tussauds Delhi.<br><br>
Badshah of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan's wax figure was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Delhi today where hundreds of fans waited with bated breath to get a glimpse of the figure of their favourite star.<br><br> 

The wax figure was made in King Khan's classic romantic pose and resembled exactly how the actor looks at present. Only the second figure of the superstar to be unveiled across Madame Tussauds, the first being in London, the wax figure required about 6 months to complete with around 20 London-based artistes working on it day and night.<br><br>

Indian weightlifter Pardeep Singh (105kg) came agonisingly close to a gold but eventually settled for a silver after a close contest with Samoa's Sanele Mao in the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, on Monday.<br><br>

Singh, the reigning Commonwealth Championships gold-medallist, lifted a total of 352kg (152kg+200kg) to claim the second spot after an exciting showdown with Mao, which had the packed arena on its feet.<br><br>

Young Mehuli Ghosh settled for the silver medal after forcing a shoot-off in the women's 10m air rifle event with a perfect final shot of 10.9 while Apurvi Chandela secured bronze in the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, on Monday.<br><br>

The 17-year-old Ghosh shot an excellent 10.9 to take the finals into a shoot-ff with Singapore's Martina Lindsay Veloso, the eventual gold medallist with a games record score of 247.2.<br><br>
