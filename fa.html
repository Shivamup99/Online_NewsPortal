<h2><font face="verdana" size="6px">Drought-induced changes in forest composition amplify effects of climate change
</font></h2><br><br>

The face of American forests is changing, thanks to climate change-induced shifts in rainfall and temperature that are causing shifts in the abundance of numerous tree species, according to a new paper by University of Florida researchers.<br><br>

The result means some forests in the eastern U.S. are already starting to look different, but more important, it means the ability of those forests to soak up carbon is being altered as well, which could in turn bring about further climate change.<br><br>

"Although climate change has been less dramatic in the eastern U.S. compared to some other regions, such as Alaska and the southwestern U.S., we were interested to see if there were signals in forest inventory data that might indicate climate-induced changes in eastern U.S. forests," said Jeremy Lichstein, senior author and a UF assistant professor of biology. "The changes we documented are easily masked by other disturbances, which is probably why no one had previously documented them. Without a long-term dataset with millions of trees, we probably could not have detected these changes."<br><br>

The study appears today in the journal Nature.<br>

Lichstein and his team based their findings on systematic forest inventories of trees in the eastern U.S. from the 1980s to the 2000s. The team looked specifically at forest biomass, tree species composition, and climate variability. The researchers found that decades of changes in water deficit have reduced forest biomass, causing an influx of trees that are more tolerant to drought but slower growing. This shift results in significant changes in forest species composition with their accompanying ecological effects and, moreover, affects the capacity of forest biomass (the mass of living trees) to store carbon. Healthy forests play a key role in global ecosystems as they contain much of the terrestrial biodiversity on the planet and act as a net sink for capturing atmospheric carbon. As climate change affects the forests, so do the forests affect climate change.<br><br>

Water stress can be caused by rising temperatures, decreases in rainfall, or a combination of the two. To study changes in soil moisture, the researchers used the Palmer drought severity index to examine average water availability and loss over the study period.<br><br>

  <h2><font face="verdana" size="6px">Cargo ships must cut their emissions in half by 2050</font></h>
  </font></h1><br>


    <center><img src="j2.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center><br>
<p><font face="cambria" size="4px"> <br><br>A new, hard-fought international deal will set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping for the first time.<br><br>

Delegates to the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization, or IMO, met for a week in London to hash out the details of the plan. On April 13, more than 170 states agreed to the new road map, which aims to reduce shipping emissions at least 50 percent below 2008 levels by 2050.<br><br>

Currently, international shipping emissions make up about 2 to 3 percent of global emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. That’s roughly on par with Germany’s annual emissions. And a 2014 IMO report calculated that international shipping emissions were on track to increase 50 to 250 percent by 2050. These emissions were not included in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the international pact to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6).<br><br>

Every year, tens of thousands of cargo ships crisscross the ocean, hauling everything from cars to coffee. Such ships largely rely on heavy fuel oil, which both contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and is a public health hazard, containing as much as 1,800 times the sulfur of diesel fuel, says James Corbett, an expert in global shipping at the University of Delaware in Newark.<br><br>

The new agreement focuses on the carbon emissions. It lays out an initial strategy to reduce emissions by encouraging shipping companies to make their ship designs more energy efficient, use alternative fuels or energy sources and streamline operations so that they consume less energy.<br><br>

The deal is an important milestone, Corbett says. “Clearly the IMO is moving into the 21st century,” he says. “The main issue that the IMO will continue to have to wrestle with is timing.” The organization, he adds, will need to walk a line between allowing the shipping industry time to adopt and prove new ship technologies — but not allow the industry to delay too long to meet environmental targets.<br><br>

Shipping industry groups have hailed the new agreement as a landmark deal. Peter Hinchliffe of the International Chamber of Shipping in London called the deal “a Paris Agreement for shipping” in a statement released April 13.<br><br>

    <center><img src="j3.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center><br><br>
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">For the first time, researchers have played matchmaker between two specific atoms, joining them together to form a molecule.<br><br>

Typically, chemists make molecules by mixing up many constituent atoms, some of which stick to each other to form the desired compounds. In the new, supercontrolled chemical reaction, researchers trapped a single sodium atom in one optical tweezer — a device that snares small particles in a laser beam — and a cesium atom in another tweezer. Both atoms were cooled to less than one ten-thousandth of a degree above absolute zero.<br><br>

The researchers moved these tweezers closer together until the laser beams overlapped, allowing the sodium and cesium atoms to collide. A third laser shot a pulse of light at the atoms to provide a boost of energy that helped the atoms bond into a sodium cesium molecule, researchers report online April 12 in Science.<br><br>

Fashioning individual molecules atom by atom could allow researchers to study atomic collisions in the most controlled environment possible, as well as to observe how molecules behave in isolation. Researchers could also use optical tweezers to construct molecules with specific quantum properties, says study coauthor Kang-Kuen Ni, a chemist at Harvard University.<br><br></font></p>

<h2><font face="verdana" size="6px">These hummingbirds aim their singing tail feathers to wow mates</font></h2><br><br>

  
    <center><img src="j4.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center><br><br>
<p><font face="cambria" size="4px">There’s more subtlety than humans have realized in dropping out of the sky so fast your tail feathers sing.<br><br>

Male Costa’s hummingbirds in western North America are masters of the tail-screaming courtship plunge. Acoustic cameras recorded these repeated stunts and revealed that, as the male whooshes down, he twists half of his tail sideways, says ornithologist Christopher J. Clark of the University of California, Riverside. That twist aims the prolonged feather whistle toward the female he’s swooping by, Clark and his colleague Emily Mistick of the University of British Colombia in Vancouver report April 12 in Current Biology.<br><br>

The recordings, which use microphone arrays to localize a sound on video, shed light on another quirk of Calypte costae’s performance. While male hummingbirds of other species swoop over the female during courtship dives, the shimmery purple-faced Costa’s zoom by on the side.<br><br>

Extra distance in the side flyby minimizes the Doppler effect on the feather sound. That effect may be familiar from the EEEEEEooooo of an ambulance’s siren that sounds high-pitched as the vehicle approaches and then seems to lower after it passes. Masking the Doppler effect could make it harder for a female to pick out the fastest divers, although researchers haven’t shown how these females perceive speed or whether it matters much to them.<br><br>

The diving sounds, made from the flutter of the outermost tail feather, also seem similar to the males’ vocalizations, Clark says. So he wonders if females find something in both especially seducti<br><br>
