Beirut: Loud explosions rocked Syria's capital and filled the sky with heavy smoke early on Saturday after US president Donald Trump announced airstrikes in retaliation for the country's alleged use of chemical weapons. Syrian television reported that air defenses responded to the attack.<br><br>

Associated Press reporters saw smoke rising from east Damascus and the sky turned orange. A huge fire could be seen from a distance to the east. Syrian television reported that a scientific research center had been hit.<br><br>

Syrian media reported that air defenses hit 13 rockets south of Damascus. After the attack ceased and the early morning skies went dark once more, vehicles with loudspeakers roamed the streets of Damascus blaring nationalist songs.<br><br>

"Good souls will not be humiliated," Syria's presidency tweeted after airstrikes began.<br><br>

Trump announced on Friday night that the three allies had launched military strikes to punish President Bashar Assad for the alleged chemical weapons use and to prevent him from doing it again.<br><br>

The US president said the US is prepared to "sustain" pressure on Assad until he ends what the president called a criminal pattern of killing his own people with internationally banned chemical weapons. It was not immediately clear whether Trump meant the allied military operation would extend beyond an initial nighttime round of missile strikes.<br><br>

Trump said the joint attack was expected to include barrages of cruise missiles launched from outside Syrian airspace. He described the main aim as establishing "a strong deterrent" against chemical weapons use.<br><br>

The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons.<br><br>

The decision to strike, after days of deliberations, marked Trump's second order to attack Syria; he authorized a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit a single Syrian airfield in April 2017 in retaliation for Assad's use of sarin gas against civilians.<br><br>

Trump chastised Syria's two main allies, Russia and Iran, for their roles in supporting "murderous dictators," and noted that Russian president Vladimir Putin had guaranteed a 2013 international agreement for Assad to get rid of all of his chemical weapons. He called on Moscow to change course and join the West in seeking a more responsible regime in Damascus.<br><br>

United Nations: A new UN report puts Myanmar's armed forces on a UN blacklist of government and rebel groups "credibly suspected" of carrying out rapes and other acts of sexual violence in conflict for the first time.<br><br>

An advance copy of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' report to the Security Council, obtained today by The Associated Press, says international medical staff and others in Bangladesh have documented that many of the almost 7,00,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled from Myanmar "bear the physical and psychological scars of brutal sexual assault."<br><br>


The UN chief said the assaults were allegedly perpetrated by the Myanmar Armed Forces, known as the Tatmadaw, "at times acting in concert with local militias, in the course of military 'clearance' operations in October 2016 and August 2017."<br><br>

"The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to this strategy, serving to humiliate, terrorise and collectively punish the Rohingya community, as a calculated tool to force them to flee their homelands and prevent their return," Guterres said.<br><br>

Buddhist-majority Myanmar doesn't recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group, insisting they are Bengali migrants from Bangladesh living illegally in the country. It has denied them citizenship, leaving them stateless.<br><br>

The recent spasm of violence began when Rohingya insurgents launched a series of attacks last August 25 on about 30 security outposts and other targets. Myanmar security forces then began a scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya villages that the UN and human rights groups have called a campaign of ethnic cleansing.<br><br>

"Violence was visited upon women, including pregnant women, who are seen as custodians and propagators of ethnic identity, as well as on young children, who represent the future of the group," Guterres said.<br><br>

"This can be linked to an inflammatory narrative alleging that high fertility rates among the Rohingya represent an existential threat to the majority population."<br><br>

The report, which will be a focus of a UN Security Council meeting on Monday on preventing sexual violence in conflict, puts 51 government, rebel and extremist groups on the list.<br><br>

  <div id="main">

    <center><img src="u9.jpg" width="800px" height="400px"></center> <br> 
    <p><font face="cambria" size="4px">New Delhi: Seeking to reset ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart KP Sharma Oli on Saturday held wide-ranging talks and vowed to step up overall engagement and take the relationship to newer heights on the basis of "equality, mutual trust and respect".<br><br>

After the delegation-level talks, Modi said India will always stand by Nepal in its quest for all-around growth, asserting that deeper cooperation between the two neighbours will strengthen democracy in Nepal.<br><br>

In his press statement, Oli, who is seen as favouring a closer relationship with China, said his government wants to build a strong edifice of "trust-based" relationship between the two nations.<br><br>

"Relations between neighbours are different from those of others. Neighbourhood realities make peaceful coexistence, based on the principles of equality, justice, mutual respect and benefits a necessity for shared destiny," Oli said in the statement in presence of Modi.<br><br>

Both the prime ministers called the talks "very satisfactory", Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters, adding the focus of the deliberations were on boosting cooperation in sectors like defence and security, agriculture, trade besides enhancing connectivity through railway network and waterways.<br><br>

"I have come to India this time with a mission to explore ways and means to enhance our relations to newer heights, commensurate with the realities of the 21st century. We want to erect a strong edifice of trust-based relations between the two close neighbours that we are. We want to create a model relationship," Oli said.<br><br>

According to a joint statement, the two prime ministers resolved to work together to take bilateral relations to newer heights on the basis of "equality, mutual trust, respect and benefit".<br><br>

There were indications that India was losing its leverage in Nepal and it became more apparent after the victory of the left alliance in the general elections following which Oli was sworn in as the prime minister.<br><br>

In 2016, Oli had publicly criticised New Delhi for interfering in Nepal's internal matters and accused it of toppling his government.<br><br>

"Being close neighbours, our destiny is intertwined. Prosperity is our common goal," said Oli.<br><br>

Gokhale said Modi conveyed to Oli that India will remain a reliable partner of Nepal and it is committed to deepening its ties with Kathmandu.<br><br>
